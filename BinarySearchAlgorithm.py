# Create a random list of numbers between 0 and 100.
# Ask the user for a number between 0 and 100 to check whether their number is in the list.
# The programme should work like this. The programme will half the list of numbers and see whether
# the users number matches the middle element in the list. If they do not match, the programme
# will check which half the number lies in, and eliminate the other half. The search then continues
# on the remaining half, again checking whether the middle element in that half is equal to the
# userâ€™s number. This process keeps on going until the programme finds the users number, or until
# the size of the subarray is 0, which means the users number isn't in the list
